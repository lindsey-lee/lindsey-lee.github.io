**Hi! I am Yeonju Lee (a.k.a. Lindsey). Welcome to my website! :)**

I am a recent graduate with a Masters degree in Statistics @ University of California, Berkeley. I am passionate about all kind of data analysis, data science and machine learning techniques, and currently looking for a challenging new employment opportunity to contribute my skills and experiences to the society. For more information, please check out my LinkedIn profile at [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-lee-1a9013a7)

In my free time I enjoy playing the violin and watching Youtube videos of the coolest violinists. I dream of performing a concerto with orchestra in the next 10 years. Yeah I know I am a beginner and you might think I cannot do it, but this is my favorite phrase in my life!
